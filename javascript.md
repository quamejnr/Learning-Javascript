# Javascript
## Introduction
Javascript code run on web browers so you don't need and a code editor to run it.

## Data Types
- undefined - set to nothing 
- null - set to null 
- boolean - `true`, `false`
- string - an immutable primitiva value that is unique
- symbol 
- number
- object - can store a lot of different key value pairs

Javascript has no floating point or integers like Python. All numbers are numbers

## Declaring Variables 
- `var myName = 'Kwame'` This can be used throughout your code
- `let myName = 'Kwame'` This can be used only in the scope in which it is declared`
- `const pi = 3.14` A variable that is constant

## Array functions
- shift = removes the first element of the array
- pop = removes the last element of an array
- push = adds an element to the end of an array
- unshift = adds an element to the beginning of the array
